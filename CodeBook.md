To obtain the tidy data set from the raw data, first the training set and the test set are concatenated to form a single data set, where subject ID, activity label, and measurements are column bound. Then measurements on the mean and standard deviation are extracted. Next the column of activity labels as numeric are changed to activity names as characters. After that, the data columns are labeled with descriptive variable names. Finally, the tidy data is created as the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
